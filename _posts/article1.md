## Integrating Selenium and GitHub Actions for a Seamless CI/CD Workflow

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) allow for automated testing and seamless deployment of code. In this project, I built a CI/CD pipeline using **GitHub Actions** integrated with **Selenium** for automated testing. Every time new code is pushed, tests run automatically, ensuring no broken functionality makes it to production.

### Pipeline Setup: Step-by-Step
1. **Initialize the GitHub repository**: Set up a repository for the project.
2. **Create the GitHub Actions Workflow**: Define the workflow for the pipeline.

### Pipeline Configuration
| Step          | Description                | Status   |
|---------------|----------------------------|----------|
| Build Project | Compile the .NET project   | Success  |
| Run Tests     | Run Selenium tests         | Success  |

### GitHub Actions YAML Example
```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
        
      - name: Set up .NET
        uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v1
        with:
          dotnet-version: '6.0.x'
      
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: dotnet restore
      
      - name: Build project
        run: dotnet build --configuration Release
      
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build
    steps:
      - name: Run tests
        run: dotnet test --configuration Release
```

### Challenges Faced
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Adjusted test scripts for different browser behaviors.
- **Handling CI Failures**: Resolved dependency issues through YAML fine-tuning.
