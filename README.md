&nbsp;After several years of dedicated work as a Sales Associate at AUTO HELP Ltd, I made the difficult decision to move on. This was not an easy choice, as I had gained valuable skills and experiences in the sales industry, especially in working with automotive products and solutions. However, after careful consideration, I realized that the opportunities for growth in my position had become limited, and the company was unable to provide the advancement I was seeking.

**The Need for New Opportunities**

&nbsp;I’m someone who thrives on growth, learning, and continuously challenging myself. As my ambitions began to shift, I started to look at the broader tech industry, where new innovations and cutting-edge tools are shaping the future. I realized that to truly fulfill my potential, I needed to explore new paths—paths that AUTO HELP Ltd, unfortunately, couldn’t provide. While the company allowed me to hone my skills in customer service and sales, I was no longer feeling challenged or able to grow in my role.

**A New Chapter in Tech and QA**

&nbsp;Recognizing the limitations of my current role, I took a bold step toward a complete career change. After months of research and planning, I decided to pursue a new path in **Quality Assurance (QA)**, a field that allows me to apply my attention to detail, problem-solving skills, and passion for technology. In my pursuit, I completed the **SoftUni QA Engineer program**, where I achieved high results and honed my technical skills in both **manual** and **automated testing**.

&nbsp;With this new career path, I’m excited about the endless opportunities that the tech world offers. By leveraging the latest technologies, like **Selenium** and even **AI tools like ChatGPT**, I’m able to approach challenges in innovative ways and quickly adapt to new environments. My experience has proven that when I’m motivated, I can learn and achieve great things in a short period of time.

**Looking Forward**

&nbsp;As I continue to build my career in QA, I’m looking forward to new challenges, new projects, and the opportunity to make a real impact in the tech industry. Leaving AUTO HELP Ltd was a tough decision, but it was one that I made with confidence in order to fully pursue my potential and ambitions.

&nbsp;I’m eager to see what the future holds as I step into a role that not only excites me but allows me to continually grow, learn, and make a difference.
